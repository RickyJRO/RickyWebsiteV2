        Born in 1998 in the heart of Lisbon, my passion for computers and
        technology has been evident since my early years. In addition to my love
        for technology, I have pursued physical activities such as basketball
        and boxing.<br/><br/> My academic journey led me to earn a bachelor's degree in
        computer science where I was exposed to a variety of programming
        languages including Python, Java, C, and Javascript. As a front-end
        developer, I have been able to turn my passion into a fulfilling career,
        and I take pride in my work.<br/><br/> Alongside my professional pursuits, I also
        indulge in my passion for travel and appreciate a well-crafted cup of
        coffee.
